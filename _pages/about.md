I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria Paris</a> in the <a href="https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/">Sierra team</a>, working with <a href="https://adrientaylor.github.io/">Adrien Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/">Aymeric Dieuleveut</a>. I completed my PhD at Lund University (2025), where I worked on systematic and computer-aided analyses and design of first-order methods for structured optimization and inclusion problems. My supervisors were <a href="https://www.control.lth.se/personnel/personnel/pontus-giselsson/">Pontus Giselsson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sbanert">Sebastian Banert</a>.

Before that, I received an MSc in engineering physics (2020), an MSc in finance (2020), and a BSc in mathematics (2015), all from Lund University. I have also spent time as a visiting student researcher at UC Berkeley (2017) and ETH Zürich (2018).
