I am a PhD student at the Department of Automatic Control at Lund University and in the WASP (Wallenberg AI, autonomous systems and software program) graduate school. My main supervisor is [Pontus Giselsson](https://www.control.lth.se/personnel/personnel/pontus-giselsson/), and my co-supervisor is [Sebastian Banert](https://github.com/sbanert). I joined the department in July 2020. 

I have received an MSc in engineering physics (2020), an MSc in finance (2020), and a BSc in mathematics (2015), all from Lund University. I have also spent time as a student research visitor at UC Berkeley (2017) and ETH ZÃ¼rich (2018). 

My research interests are continuous optimization and its applications, e.g., machine learning, control, and finance. I currently focus on the design and performance analysis of first-order algorithms for convex optimization and monotone inclusion problems.
